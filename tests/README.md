# Tests

> Tests are **executable documentation**. They define what the system does, what constraints exist, and what was already tried.

Place your test files here. Agents will read these to understand existing behavior before making changes.

## Guidelines

- Name tests descriptively: `test_<feature>_<scenario>.py` or equivalent
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Add regression tests when fixing bugs
- Tests should be runnable independently and in any order
