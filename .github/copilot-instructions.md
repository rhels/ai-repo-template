# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This is an AI-first repository. Before making changes:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for rules and conventions
2. Read `MEMORY.md` for curated project knowledge
3. Read `memory/changelog.md` for recent context

After making changes:
- Update `memory/changelog.md` with what you changed and why
- Update `MEMORY.md` if you discovered something non-obvious
- Add failure records to `memory/failures/` if something didn't work

Tests are mandatory. Run them before committing. Add tests for new behavior.
